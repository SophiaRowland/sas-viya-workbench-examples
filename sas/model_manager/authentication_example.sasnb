[{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"# Building the Bridge to SAS Viya\r\nTo interact with SAS Viya from SAS Viya Workbench, you need to build the bridge between SAS Viya and SAS Viya Workbench. This involves opening traffic between the two systems as well as authenticating to SAS Viya. **These steps are required to register models to SAS Model Manager.** First things first, open up a terminal and run this code to find your IP Address:\r\n\r\n> curl ip.me\r\n\r\nFrom SAS Viya, your administrator will need to add this IP address to your SAS Viya allow list. \r\n\r\nIn your SAS Viya environment, open SAS Studio and run the following code: \r\n\r\n> proc options option = SERVICESBASEURL; run;\r\n\r\nThis will return your root URL to the SAS log. Copy that URL and paste it below for safe keeping:\r\n\r\n>  My URL: \r\n\r\nNow open a new terminal below. Run the following command:\r\n\r\n> sas-viya profile init\r\n\r\nWhen prompted for a server, paste the URL you saved earlier. Next, you will need to generate an access code. Running the following command will return a link. Click the link and login. This will return an access code. Copy the code and paste it back into the terminal. \r\n\r\n> sas-viya -k auth loginCode\r\n\r\nThis will create an access token. To view the token, run the following: \r\n\r\n> sas-viya profile show -key access-token\r\n\r\nCopy this token and replace the access token string in the myToken.sas file. Run the myToken.sas file and your token is ready to use! If you encounter a problem generating the token, then traffic from your SAS Viya Workbench may not have been configured correctly. Note that tokens are only valid for one hour by default. So, if youâ€™re working for longer than an hour, you may need to re-generate your token. \r\n\r\n***","outputs":[]}]
